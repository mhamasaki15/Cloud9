        All the single <mark>ladies</mark>
        (All the single ladies)
        All the single ladies
        (All the single ladies)
        All the single ladies
        (All the single ladies)
        All the single ladies
        Now put your hands up
        Up in the club, just broke up
        I'm doing my own little thing
        You decided to dip and now you wanna trip
        'Cause another brother noticed me
        I'm up on him, he up on me
        Don't pay him any attention
        'Cause I cried my tears for three good years
        You can't be mad at me
        'Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
        If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
        Don't be mad once you see that he want it
        If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
        Oh, oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh
